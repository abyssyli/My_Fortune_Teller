Update: 又改了一下，因为有时候在输入y/n的时候用户会手滑输入问题，这样就直接退出了，要设置成只能回答y和n这里，而不是输入y才继续其他的一律退出。

## Project Proposal

### Background
In many cultures, symbolic systems such as fortune-telling, tarot, oracles, or omens have long been used to provide individuals with emotional support, narrative direction, or perceived control. Even when the mechanism is random or clearly artificial, people often project personal meaning onto the results—and sometimes, that suggestion alone is enough to change behavior.

This project simulates that effect through a minimal, code-based “cyber divination” system, aiming to study how people may respond to symbolic affirmations or rejections (e.g., “You will succeed”).

**Cyber-Divination and Behavioral Suggestion: A Code-Based Experimental System**

**Overview**  
This project explores how symbolic prediction (e.g., card draws saying "You will succeed") can influence human behavior. The system simulates a fortune-telling experience and tests whether positive or negative symbolic feedback affects users’ willingness to act.

The goal is to use code—not surveys—to model how psychological priming works through symbolic feedback.

**System Design**
The Python-based system includes:

- Free-text user input  
- Random card draw (Lenormand-style)  
- Rule-based feedback (positive / negative / neutral)  
- User response prompts  
- Behavior logging for basic analysis

**Future Extension: LLM Integration**  
The project reserves an interface for adding LLMs to automatically generate symbolic interpretations based on card results and user questions. This will support future exploration of how AI-generated suggestions and language style can enhance human confidence, motivation, and agency.

上述研究计划仅个人幻想，白日做梦，自不量力，不要笑我XD
