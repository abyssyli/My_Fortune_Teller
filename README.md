Update:
改了三个地方。第一，把问题里的in english去掉，我他妈又不是美国人我凭什么用英文算命?第二，退出改成手动设置，别问完一个问题就退出，你见过谁算命只问一个问题? 我想问几个就问几个，问够了再退出不行? 第三，记录算命结果，输出log文件.
我真难过，真的难过。一事无成，又肥又腻，童心未泯，有没有钱，又没有phd，又没有人，又没有publication，我都无语了😂

## Project Proposal

### Background
In many cultures, symbolic systems such as fortune-telling, tarot, oracles, or omens have long been used to provide individuals with emotional support, narrative direction, or perceived control. Even when the mechanism is random or clearly artificial, people often project personal meaning onto the results—and sometimes, that suggestion alone is enough to change behavior.

This project simulates that effect through a minimal, code-based “cyber divination” system, aiming to study how people may respond to symbolic affirmations or rejections (e.g., “You will succeed”).

**Cyber-Divination and Behavioral Suggestion: A Code-Based Experimental System**

**Overview**  
This project explores how symbolic prediction (e.g., card draws saying "You will succeed") can influence human behavior. The system simulates a fortune-telling experience and tests whether positive or negative symbolic feedback affects users’ willingness to act.

The goal is to use code—not surveys—to model how psychological priming works through symbolic feedback.

**System Design**
The Python-based system includes:

- Free-text user input  
- Random card draw (Lenormand-style)  
- Rule-based feedback (positive / negative / neutral)  
- User response prompts  
- Behavior logging for basic analysis

**Future Extension: LLM Integration**  
The project reserves an interface for adding LLMs to automatically generate symbolic interpretations based on card results and user questions. This will support future exploration of how AI-generated suggestions and language style can enhance human confidence, motivation, and agency.

上述研究计划仅个人幻想，白日做梦，自不量力，不要笑我XD
